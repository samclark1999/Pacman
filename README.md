# Pacman

<img src="PacMan1.png" width="200px" height="200px"/>

Pacman is an exercise in which an animation of pacman bounces off the wall boundaries and heads in the opposite direction, opening and closing its mouth.
## How to Run
Make sure you clone Pacman Repo and that pacman.js, index.html, and PNG images are on your local computer. Next, you can drag index.html into your browser and you should see pacman go.
## Future Improvements
I would like to code some user functions where the user can control pacman around a browser screen. The control would be the arrow keys and would need new code and photos for pacman to go up and down. This would also require code for top and bottom wall boundaries.
